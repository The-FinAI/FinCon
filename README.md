## Code
We apologize for the delay in open-sourcing this project.<br>
Our data agent currently relies on several commercial APIs, which makes it challenging to release the full system and associated data directly.<br>
We are actively working on anonymizing and restructuring the components, and plan to release the code within the next 3–4 months.<br>

While we are preparing the open-source release of this project, please feel free to explore our Single-Agent projects, where we have open-sourced the full codebase and the majority of the dataset. It supports rapid deployment for verification and experimentation.
